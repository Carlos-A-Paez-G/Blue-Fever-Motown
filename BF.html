            <p>Louise hails from Cork, Ireland; land of the wee leprechaun and tea…the latter of which she loves, but only if it's Barry's tea and with low fat milk. She has been singing since she was old enough to drink tea. Louise is also a first grade teacher and is quite happy that those humans are tinier than her. 
                When she is not singing or teaching tiny humans, you can find her drinking tea, reading and chilling by a pool (separately or simultaneously). She loves to sing most kinds of music although Metallica is somewhat out of her wheelhouse. This is her fourth year in Blue Fever and the tea break is her favourite part of rehearsals. 
                <br><br>
                Did we mention she loves tea? 
            </p>

                long-term resident of Abu Dhabi, she is one of the founding members of 
                Blue Fever. Currently starring in her own reality show, A Modern Cinderella:

            <p>Nicholas is an exceptionally busy ICU doc who 
                enjoys removing his N95 and subjecting any captive audience to high-
                pitched keening noise (having been a “keen” tenor for the best part of his 
                adult years).   
                <br>
                Apparently, this is a highly effective, if lesser-known, traditional Swedish 
                technique for catching fish…   
                <br>
                 During his (limited) spare time, he spends his days out on the water.

        <h3>Manoj Singanayagam< - Tenor</h3>
        <img class="portrait" src="../images/Manoj.jpeg" alt="portrait">
            <p>Manoj joined the Blue Fever family last year. He hails from island paradise of Sri Lanka, but has 
                called UAE home for the last decade and a half. By day, he is crunching numbers at the bank, by 
                night, he swaps the spreadsheets for music scores. When the numbers start to blur, he turns up 
                the volume and let the melodies balance his sanity. From choral groups to church choirs, he's sung 
                his heart out across every genre of music. He is also a keen thespian and was part of several 
                amateur theatre groups back in Sri Lanka. Besides music, his other forms of escape are netflix, 
                sports and travel.</p>

        <h3>Brent Walker - Tenor</h3>

                <br>
                He has lived in Abu Dhabi since 2015 and is lucky to be in his third season with Blue Fever.
                <br>
                Sometimes a tenor, sometimes a baritone, Brent enjoys the challenge of finding that moment when voices 
                blend to create something special.</p>

        <h3>Sally O'Neill - Alto</h3>

                arrived in Abu Dhabi FIFTEEN or so years ago directly from her homeland

            <p>Take a moment while you're here. Live performance is always in the service of building community. 
                You are currently in community with the people around you. So consider, in this free time that 
                you have, what is the community you want to build? What are the things you care about? What change 
                do you wish came about? The world is burning and dowsing its flames requires us to be fluid like
