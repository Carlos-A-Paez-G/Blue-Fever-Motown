        <h1 class="center">WELCOME!</h1>
        <p>Blue Fever are delighted to welcome you all to this evening, celebrating our 10th year at The Club and 
			thank you all for supporting both Blue Fever and community arts within Abu Dhabi.  
			<br><br>
			The members of Blue Fever are very grateful to The Club, its staff and to Arun Babu 
			(Events & Banqueting Manager) in particular, for their support and assistance in bringing this event 
			to you.   
			<br><br>
			We are joined this evening by our friends; the accomplished, 
			professional musicians of Retromantics. Together, we promise you a fun-filled, entertaining evening. 
		</p>

		<h1>THANK YOU!</h1>
		<p>
			Special thanks to: 
			<br>
			<b>Our supremely talented Musical Director Helen Kerr,</b> who is leading us for the second year and 
			ensures.  Helen is also Director of Music & Instrumental at BSAK and is instrumental (pardon the pun) 
			in leading its students to some amazing accomplishments this year, including scooping 12 trophies in the 
			recent Young Musician of the Gulf Competition 2024.  She applies the same professionalism and leadership 
			to enhancing our a cappella performances.
			<br><br>
			<b>Laura,</b> for always graciously hosting our rehearsals at her lovely home and for providing 
			home-baked goodies at our coffee breaks…., not to mention her family for putting up with us!  
			<br><br>
			<b>Our own guitarist extraordinaire, Steve Haynes,</b>who has also 
			devoted a huge amount of time and effort into putting together our Motown Story. 
			<br><br>
			The entire production team and members of the groups for their contributions, 
			time and energy invested in bringing you this event.
			<br>
		</p>
